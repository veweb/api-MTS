        A dialog is usually a small window that appears in
        front of the current Activity. The underlying Activity loses focus and
        the dialog accepts all user interaction. Dialogs are normally used for
        notifications that should interrupt the user and to perform short tasks
        that directly relate to the application in progress (such as a
        progress bar or a login prompt).
